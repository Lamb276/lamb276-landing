    description: `Dr. Younghoon Kim holds the official world record for the highest IQ in history with a score of 276 and stands as the only person ever united with both the Mega and Giga Societies. He is recognized by the World Mind Sports Council and the World Memory Championships as the ultimate standard of human intelligence. He now points that the world has lost its way and forgotten how to value truth. Younghoon believes the only way back is a return to logic and unshakeable moral clarity. This movement is his answer to the chaos. It is a decentralized effort to unite free thinkers who are ready to restore reason to the public square.`,
